       "\"Human existence is scary and confusing. A few hundred thousand years ago, we became conscious and found ourselves in a strange place. It was filled with other beings. We could eat some; some could eat us. There was liquid stuff we could drink; things we could use to make more things. The daytime sky had a tiny yellow ball that warmed our skin. The night sky was filled with beautiful lights. This place was obviously made for us. Something was watching over us. We were home. This made everything much less scary and confusing. But the older we got, the more we learned about the world and ourselves. We learned that the twinkling lights are not shining beautifully for us, they just are. We learned that we're not at the center of what we now call the universe, and that it is much, much older than we thought. We learned that we're made of many little dead things, which make up bigger things that are not dead, for some reason, and that we're just another temporary stage in a history going back over a billion years. We learned, in awe, that we live on a moist speck of dust moving around a medium-sized star in a quiet region of one arm of an average galaxy, which is part of a galaxy group that we will never leave. And this group is only one of thousands that, together, make up a galaxy supercluster. But even our supercluster is only one in thousands that make up what we call the observable universe. The universe might be a million times bigger, but we will never know. We can throw words around like two hundred million galaxies or trillions of stars or bazillions of planets, but all of these numbers mean nothing. Our brains can't comprehend these concepts. The universe is too big. There is too much of it. But size is not the most troubling concept we have to deal with. It's time, or, more precisely, the time we have. If you're lucky enough to live to one hundred, you have five thousand two hundred weeks at your disposal. If you're twenty-five now, then you have three thousand nine hundred weeks left. If you're going to die at seventy, then there are two thousand three hundred and forty weeks left - a lot of time, but also ... not really. And then what? Your biological processes will break down, and the dynamic pattern that is you will stop beinge dynamic. It will dissolve until there is no you left. Some believe that there is a part of us we can't see or measure, but we have no way to find out, so this life might be it and we might end up dead forever. This is less scary than it sounds, though. If you don't remember the 13.75 billion years that went by before you existed, Then the trillions and trillions and trillions of years that come after will pass in no time once you're gone. Close your eyes. Count to 1. That's how long forever feels. And as far as we know, in the end, the universe itself will die and nothing will ever change again. Our videos induce existential dread in many people, and the last few minutes probably haven't helped. So, for once, we want to offer a different way of looking at these things: an unscientific, subjective point of view, the philosophy of Kurzgesagt, if you want. Please take it with a grain of salt; we don't know any more about human existence than you do. We counter existential dread with optimistic nihilism. What do we mean by that? Well, to summarize, it seems very unlikely that 200 trillion trillion stars have been made for us. In a way, it feels like the cruelest joke in existence has been played on us. We became self-aware only to realize this story is not about us. While it is great to know about electrons and the powerhouse of the cell, Science doesn't do a lot to make this less depressing. Okay, but so what? You only get one shot at life, which is scary, but it also sets you free. If the universe ends in heat death, every humiliation you suffer in your life will be forgotten. Every mistake you made will not matter in the end. Every bad thing you did will be voided. If our life is all we get to experience, then it's the only thing that matters. If the universe has no principles, the only principles relevant are the ones we decide on. If the universe has no purpose, then we get to dictate what its purpose is. Humans will most certainly cease to exist at some point, but before we do, we get to explore ourselves and the world around us. We get to experience feelings. We get to experience food, books, sunrises, and being with each other. The fact that we're even able to think about these things is already kind of incredible. It's easy to think of ourselves as separated from everything, but this is not true. We are as much the universe as a neutron star or a black hole or a nebula. Even better, actually, we are its thinking and feeling part: the centre organs of the universe. We are truly free in a universe-sized playground, so we might as well aim to be happy and to build some kind of utopia in the stars. It's not as if we've found out everything there is to know We don't know why the rules of the universe are as they are, how life came into existence, what life is. We have no idea what consciousness is or if we are alone in the universe. But we can try to find some answers. There are billions of stars to visit, diseases to cure, people to help, happy feelings to be experienced, and video games to finish. There is so much to do. So, wrapping up, you've probably used up a good chunk of the time available to you. If this is our one shot at life, there is no reason not to have fun and live as happy as possible. Bonus points if you made the life of other people better. More bonus points if you help build a galactic human empire. Do the things that make you feel good. You get to decide whatever this means for you.\""

Ոմանք կարող էին մեզ ուտել: Հեղուկ նյութեր կար, որ կարող էինք խմել; բաներ, որոնք մենք կարող էինք օգտագործել ավելի շատ բաներ անելու համար: The երեկային երկինքը փոքրիկ դեղին գնդակ ուներ, որը տաքացրեց մեր մաշկը: Գիշերային երկինքը լցվեց գեղեցիկ լույսերով: Այս վայրն ակնհայտորեն արվեց մեզ համար: Ինչ-որ բան հետեւում էր մեզ: Մենք տուն էինք: Սա ամեն ինչ շատ ավելի քիչ վախեցավ եւ շփոթեցնող: Բայց ավելի հինացանք, այնքան ավելի շատ իմացանք աշխարհի եւ մեր մասին: Տեղեկացանք, որ շողշողացող լույսերը գեղեցիկ չեն փայլում մեզ համար, նրանք պարզապես են: Մենք իմացանք, որ մենք այն կենտրոնում չենք, թե ինչն ենք այժմ անվանում տիեզերք, եւ որ այն շատ ավելի հին է, քան կարծում ենք: Մենք իմացանք, որ մենք պատրաստված ենք շատ փոքր մեռած բաներից, որոնք կազմում են ավելի մեծ բաներ, որոնք ինչ-ինչ պատճառներով մեռած չեն, եւ որ մենք եւս մեկ միլիարդ տարի վերադառնում ենք պատմության մեջ մեկ այլ ժամանակավոր փուլ: Մենք սովորեցինք, վախենում, որ մենք ապրում ենք փոշու խոնավ բծերի վրա, որոնք շարժվում են միջին չափի աստղի շուրջը միջին գալակտիկայի մեկ բազայի հանգիստ մարզում, որը գալակտիկայի խմբի մի մասն է, որը մենք երբեք չենք հեռանա: Եվ այս խումբը հազարից միայն մեկն է, որ միասին կազմում է գալակտիկայի սուպերլաստեր: Բայց նույնիսկ մեր սուպերմարկետը հազարավոր մարդիկ են, որոնք կազմում են այն, ինչ մենք անվանում ենք դիտորդ տիեզերք: Տիեզերքը կարող է միլիոն անգամ ավելի մեծ լինել, բայց մենք երբեք չենք իմանա: Մենք կարող ենք բառեր նետել երկու հարյուր միլիոն գալակտիկաների կամ տհաճ աստղերի կամ մոլորակների երթեւեկության պես, բայց այս բոլոր համարները ոչինչ չեն նշանակում: Մեր ուղեղը չի կարող հասկանալ այս հասկացությունները: Տիեզերքը չափազանց մեծ է: Դրանից շատ բան կա: Բայց չափը ամենաուշակալի գաղափարը չէ, որի հետ մենք պետք է գործ ունենանք: Ժամանակն է, կամ ավելի ճիշտ, մեր ունեցած ժամանակը: Եթե \\u200b\\u200bբավականաչափ հաջողակ եք հարյուր հարյուր ապրելու համար, ձեր տրամադրության տակ ունեք հինգ հազար երկու հարյուր շաբաթ: Եթե \\u200b\\u200bհիմա քսանհինգ տարեկան եք, ապա մնացել եք երեք հազար ինը հարյուր շաբաթ: Եթե \\u200b\\u200bդուք մեռնեք յոթանասունից, ապա մնացել է երկու հազար երեք հարյուր քառասուն շաբաթ, շատ ժամանակ, բայց նաեւ ... իրականում: Եվ հետո ինչ: Ձեր կենսաբանական գործընթացները կխորտակվեն, եւ դինամիկ օրինակը, որը դուք կդադարեցնեք դինամիկ մնալ: Դա կվերածվի այնքան ժամանակ, քանի դեռ չեք մնացել: Ոմանք կարծում են, որ մեզանից մի մասն կա, մենք չենք կարող տեսնել կամ չափել, բայց մենք պարզելու միջոց չենք, ուստի այս կյանքը կարող է հավերժ մեռել: Սա պակաս սարսափելի է, քան հնչում է: Եթե \\u200b\\u200bդուք չեք հիշում 13,75 միլիարդ տարի, որը անցել է նախքան գոյություն ունենալը, ապա այն տհաճ ու տհաճ տարիներ, որոնք գալիս են այն բանից հետո, երբ կանցնեն ոչ մի անգամ, երբ դուք չեք գնացել: Փակեք ձեր աչքերը: Հաշվեք 1-ին: Դա ինչքան է զգում ընդմիշտ: Եվ որքանով մենք գիտենք, վերջում տիեզերքն ինքնին կմեռնի, եւ ոչինչ այլեւս ոչինչ չի փոխվի: Մեր տեսանյութերը շատ մարդկանց մեջ առաջացնում են գոյություն ունեցող վախ, եւ վերջին մի քանի րոպեները, հավանաբար, չեն օգնել: Այսպիսով, մեկ անգամ, մենք ուզում ենք առաջարկել այս բաները նայելու այլ եղանակ, անիմաստ, սուբյեկտիվ տեսակետ, եթե ցանկանում եք kurzgesagt- ի փիլիսոփայությունը: Խնդրում ենք վերցնել այն հացահատիկով աղով. Մենք այլեւս չգիտենք մարդկային գոյության մասին, քան դուք: Մենք հակասում ենք գոյություն ունեցող վախի, լավատեսական նիհիլիզմով: Ինչ նկատի ունենք դրանով: Դե, ամփոփելու համար, կարծես թե շատ քիչ հավանական է, որ 200 տրիլիոն տրիլիոն աստղ արվել է մեզ համար: Ինչ-որ կերպ զգում է, որ մեզ վրա խաղացել են գոյության դաժան կատակներ: Մենք ինքնասիրահարվեցինք միայն այս պատմությունը գիտակցելու համար մեր մասին չէ: Թեեւ հիանալի է իմանալ էլեկտրոնների եւ բջիջի էլեկտրակայանի մասին, գիտությունը շատ բան չի անում այս պակաս ճնշող դարձնելու համար: Լավ, բայց ինչ? Դուք միայն մեկ կրակոց եք ստանում կյանքում, ինչը սարսափելի է, բայց այն նաեւ ձեզ ազատ է դնում: Եթե \\u200b\\u200bտիեզերքն ավարտվի ջերմության մեջ, ձեր կյանքի մեջ տառապող յուրաքանչյուր նվաստացում կմղչի: Վերջում ձեր կատարած յուրաքանչյուր սխալ նշանակություն չունի: Ձեր արած յուրաքանչյուր վատ բան կհեռացվի: Եթե \\u200b\\u200bմեր կյանքը այն ամենն է, ինչ մենք զգում ենք, ապա դա միակ բանն է, որ կարեւոր է: Եթե \\u200b\\u200bտիեզերքը չունի սկզբունքներ, ապա միակ սկզբունքներն են, որոնց մասին մենք որոշում ենք: Եթե \\u200b\\u200bտիեզերքը նպատակ չունի, ապա մենք պետք է թելադրենք, թե որն է դրա նպատակը: Մարդիկ, անշուշտ, կդադարեն ինչ-որ պահի գոյություն ունենալ, բայց նախքան մենք անենք, մենք պետք է ուսումնասիրենք մեր եւ մեր շրջապատի աշխարհը: Մենք ստանում ենք զգացմունքներ զգալու համար: Մենք ստանում ենք զգալու սնունդ, գրքեր, արեւածագ եւ միմյանց հետ լինելը: Այն փաստը, որ մենք նույնիսկ կարողանում ենք մտածել այս բաների մասին, արդեն անհավատալի է: Հեշտ է մտածել ինքներս մեզ մասին, ինչպես ամեն ինչից առանձնացված, բայց դա ճիշտ չէ: Մենք նույնքան տիեզերք ենք, որքան նեյտրոնային աստղը կամ սեւ անցքը կամ միգամած: Նույնիսկ ավելի լավ, իրականում մենք նրա մտածելակերպն ու զգում ենք մաս. Տիեզերքի կենտրոնական օրգանները: Մենք իսկապես ազատ ենք տիեզերքի չափի խաղահրապարակում, այնպես որ մենք կարող ենք նաեւ երջանիկ լինել եւ աստղերում կառուցել ինչ-որ ուտոպիա: Ասես մենք պարզեցինք, որ այնտեղ ամեն ինչ կա, որ չգիտենք, թե ինչու են տիեզերքի կանոնները այնպես, ինչպես նրանք են, ինչ է կյանքը: Մենք գաղափար չունենք, թե ինչ գիտակցություն է, կամ եթե մենք միայնակ ենք տիեզերքում: Բայց մենք կարող ենք փորձել գտնել որոշ պատասխաններ: Կան միլիարդավոր աստղեր այցելելու, բուժելու հիվանդություններ, մարդիկ, ովքեր կօգնեն զգույշ լինել, եւ տեսախաղերը կավարտվեն: Դա շատ անելիքներ կան: Այսպիսով, փաթաթվելով, դուք հավանաբար օգտագործել եք ձեզ համար մատչելի ժամանակի լավ կտոր: Եթե \\u200b\\u200bսա մեր մեկ կրակոցն է կյանքում, պատճառ չկա, որ հնարավորինս երջանիկ չլինեն եւ ապրեն: Բոնուսային միավորներ, եթե ավելի լավ եք դարձրել այլ մարդկանց կյանքը: Ավելի շատ բոնուսային միավորներ, եթե օգնում եք ստեղծել գալակտիկական մարդկային կայսրություն: Կատարեք այն բաները, որոնք ձեզ լավ են զգում: Դուք պետք է որոշեք այն, ինչ դա նշանակում է ձեզ համար:'"
