00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,580
On those cold, rainy days when you forget your rain jacket or umbrella and you want

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:07,790
to stay as dry as possibleâ€¦ should you walk and spend more time in the rain? Or should

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,160
you run, which means you'll be smashing into more raindrops from the side?

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,950
Assuming you haven't been fully soaked yet and you aren't jumping into puddles, the answer

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,880
is simple. As you move out of the way of one falling raindrop, you move into the way of

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,169
another. So the amount of rain hitting the top of you is constant, regardless of how

7
00:00:22,169 --> 00:00:25,179
fast you're going. Alternatively, you can picture that the raindrops themselves are

8
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:28,919
stationary and you (and the earth beneath you) are moving upwards through the rain!

9
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:32,759
And since the volume of a parallelepiped (that's a 3D parallelogram) doesn't depend at all

10
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,590
on its slant, then no matter how fast you're moving horizontally the same amount of rain

11
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,460
will land on top of you each second.

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,600
Now, if you're not moving, the rain from the top is all you'll get. But if you ARE moving,

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,739
you'll also run into raindrops from the side and you'll get wetter. So in any given second,

14
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:50,539
you stay driest by standing still, and the faster you move the wetter you become.

15
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:54,249
But if you're trying to get from point A to point B, then standing still won't do you

16
00:00:54,249 --> 00:00:58,420
much good. And en route from point A to point B, the total amount of rain you run into from

17
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,789
the side has nothing to do with how fast you're going - just like how a snowplow will plow

18
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:07,060
the same amount of snow from a stretch of road regardless of the exact speed it drives.

19
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,320
In the case of running through the rain, you can figure that out using parallelepipeds

20
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,159
again.

21
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,680
So over a given period of time, the same amount of rain will hit you from the top, regardless

22
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,090
of how fast you're going. And over a given distance, you'll hit the same amount of rain

23
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,909
from the side - again, regardless of how fast you're going.

24
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,829
So your total wetness is equal to the wetness per second for rain from the top times the

25
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:28,560
amount of time you spend in the rain, plus the wetness per meter for rain from the side

26
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,479
times the number of meters you travel.

27
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,869
So to stay driest getting from one point to another, you should try to minimize the amount

28
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:37,549
of water falling onto you from above. And quite simply, that means getting out of the

29
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:38,399
rain as fast as possible.
