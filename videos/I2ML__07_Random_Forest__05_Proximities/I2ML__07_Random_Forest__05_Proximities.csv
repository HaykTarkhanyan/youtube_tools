1,"00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,440",welcome back to introduction to machine
2,"00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,240",learning I'm lud bman and in this video
3,"00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,080",I will tell you about proximities and
4,"00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,639",random forests first we have to
5,"00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,719",understand how random forests can be
6,"00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,200",used to define proximities and then we
7,"00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:18,119",want to learn about how these
8,"00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:21,439",proximities can be used and for which uh
9,"00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:24,560",use cases these can be
10,"00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:28,119",used so first about Computing these
11,"00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,800",proximities so the goal is to compute
12,"00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:33,160",proximities between
13,"00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,680",observations okay so you have an
14,"00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:38,640",observation x i and an observation XJ
15,"00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,120",and you want to know how far they are
16,"00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,840",away from each other or how near they
17,"00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:48,920",are to each other so here we look at two
18,"00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:51,520",IDs one and two and at the features of
19,"00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,280",these observations so we are not looking
20,"00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,160",at the Target variables but just at the
21,"00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:00,719",features so in this case color form and
22,"00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:03,960",length and what we do here is is that
23,"00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:07,119",first we train uh random forest and
24,"00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,759",after training we push all observations
25,"00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:15,159",through each tree so we put or push
26,"00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:20,360",observation one through tree 1 tre2 and
27,"00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:24,520",tree3 and the same for observation two
28,"00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:27,200",goes through all three trees and then we
29,"00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:30,880",just compare the predictions of each of
30,"00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:36,079",all these trees and we count how many
31,"00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,159",times a tree predicts the same class for
32,"00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,880",those two
33,"00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:43,079",observations
34,"00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:46,560",so in this case tree
35,"00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:49,159",one predicts different Target variables
36,"00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,200",for observation one and two but trees
37,"00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:56,360",two and
38,"00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:58,920",three predict the same value okay so in
39,"00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,680",two or three cases they have the same
40,"00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:05,399",value so proximity of these two
41,"00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,200",observations is 2 / 3 now we can do this
42,"00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,599",for all the observations in the data set
43,"00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:14,000",so we have n observations in a data set
44,"00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:16,160",so we get n * n or a matrix with n * n
45,"00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,040",entries which is of course a symmetric
46,"00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:23,160",Matrix because X1 and X2 have the same
47,"00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,160",proximity as X2 and X1
48,"00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:28,959",sure what can we do with these
49,"00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:32,760",proximities first we can try to just
50,"00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,720",visualize the data set that we have so
51,"00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,560",usually a data set has more than just
52,"00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,480",two variables so it's hard to have a
53,"00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,120",good plot of this data set because you
54,"00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,920",well have too many dimensions to fit on
55,"00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,319",a screen or on the paper so what we can
56,"00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,920",do is we compute this proximity Matrix
57,"00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:54,519",so each row and each column of this
58,"00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,280",proximity Matrix refer to one
59,"00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:00,400",observation of course one observation is
60,"00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,799",always perfectly to to itself
61,"00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,280",but others are perhaps not and then we
62,"00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:08,080",can use this proximity Matrix perhaps
63,"00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,360",first we have to take the inverse to
64,"00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,400",compute distances but then we can
65,"00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:16,560",visualize these distances for example
66,"00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,480",what we see here is that well the the
67,"00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,440",three classes of this penguin data set
68,"00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,879",ardelia chinstrap and gen two can be
69,"00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:28,080",seen here from this plot but what we Al
70,"00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:32,319",also see is that for example this class
71,"00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:36,200",Adelia has a r the high inclass variance
72,"00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:40,439",so values are in this in this area as
73,"00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:43,159",opposed to gen two which are perhaps not
74,"00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:45,280",that diverse inside the class okay so we
75,"00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:48,200",have perhaps learned something about the
76,"00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,319",data set and we also see that well these
77,"00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,640",two classes and also the third class
78,"00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,159",overlap with each other which perhaps
79,"00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:59,200",will make it challenging to train a good
80,"00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:59,200",classification model right
81,"00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,640",also using this visualization we can
82,"00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:08,640",locate outliers for example this point
83,"00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:11,079",over here belongs to the class chinstrap
84,"00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,879",but well it's quite far away from all
85,"00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:14,840",the other observations so yeah it's a
86,"00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,639",perhaps
87,"00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:21,479",untypical data point of this
88,"00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:24,600",class we could also use this to have a
89,"00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:26,360",look for mislabeled data points this can
90,"00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,199",also happen especially in manually
91,"00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:32,160",labeled data sets or data set where the
92,"00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:35,000",target variable is defined by a human
93,"00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,520",inspector somehow so we have to I guess
94,"00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,120",a lot in for example medical contexts or
95,"00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:44,080",other computer vision tasks where people
96,"00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,840",are asked to label images so perhaps
97,"00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:50,800",they also commit errors and perhaps we
98,"00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:52,440",can see um some of these mislabeled data
99,"00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,400",points with these proximity
100,"00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,400",visualizations as
101,"00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,800",well as third use case of these
102,"00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,080",proximities is the imputation of missing
103,"00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,520",data
104,"00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:11,160",points so let's say we have this data
105,"00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:13,680",set here with four columns color form
106,"00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,880",original length or four features and we
107,"00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,319",have missing variables this
108,"00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,840",one and that
109,"00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:25,840",one and or missing yeah missing
110,"00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,639",observations here and what we could do
111,"00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,520",of course is to replace all these
112,"00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:33,240",missings with the median of each column
113,"00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,160",okay so that's totally fine we can
114,"00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,680",compute that here we did that so we just
115,"00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,280",imputed those two observations with the
116,"00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:44,639",median of these two observations which
117,"00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,400",is brown and 14 in these two cases and
118,"00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,319",now that we have a data set without
119,"00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,440",missing values we can compute the
120,"00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:53,560",proximities okay so we have to do some
121,"00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,440",imputation first to compute the missing
122,"00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,319",values but yeah now we can do this
123,"00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,639",that's the second step now we've
124,"00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,919",computed the proximities after a data
125,"00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,160",set has changed and now we can replace
126,"00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:07,479",the missings by a weighted average of
127,"00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,000",the non-m missings so let's say we look
128,"00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:12,080",at the column length here and remember
129,"00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,800",that this observation was missing
130,"00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,880",beforehand so after imputing the median
131,"00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,800",of all the missing values we can compute
132,"00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,280",the proximities and for example the
133,"00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,759",third observation and the second
134,"00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:28,680",observations seem to be not that far
135,"00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:32,400",away so we take a weighted average of 14
136,"00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:35,120",19 and and 14 but 19 gets a high weight
137,"00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,120",because this proximity between these two
138,"00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,599",observations is rather High
139,"00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:44,919",okay so we could say we are done but
140,"00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:48,240",because we computed the proximities on
141,"00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:50,360",the rather under complex imputation by
142,"00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,520",just imputing the median perhaps we can
143,"00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,720",do this again and again to get rid of
144,"00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:58,080",this under complex imputation and have
145,"00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,680",this kind of better imputation with the
146,"00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,919",weighted average using proximities in a
