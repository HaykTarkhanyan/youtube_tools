this is a regular picture of Robert Oppenheimer and this is a photo of him by the greatest portrait photographer of all time so what's the difference is it the lighting the environment the facial expression these are all the work of Armenian photographer Yousef ksh who said it was his goal to capture greatness like you can tell the difference between someone just snapping a photo versus someone who understands what exactly makes that person great and to understand a person believed that it takes respect and time like he spent 6 hours with Fidel smoking cigars before he was able to pull this Moment of Truth out of him and for chst Pablo Cals ksh saw that what made him great was his dedication so his portrait doesn't even show his face which is way different than the way you would photograph an artist whose passion makes them great celebrity portraits these days can be Lush and visually interesting but it's really special when the photographer knows how to capture that unique thing that makes a person great
