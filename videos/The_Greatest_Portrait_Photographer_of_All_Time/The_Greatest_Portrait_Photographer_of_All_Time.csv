2,"00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,919",Oppenheimer and this is a photo of him
3,"00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,920",by the greatest portrait photographer of
4,"00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:11,360",all
5,"00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:14,280",time so what's the difference is it the
6,"00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,039",lighting the environment the facial
7,"00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,880",expression these are all the work of
8,"00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:21,279",Armenian photographer Yousef ksh who
9,"00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,680",said it was his goal to capture
10,"00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,199",greatness like you can tell the
11,"00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,080",difference between someone just snapping
12,"00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:28,439",a photo versus someone who understands
13,"00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,720",what exactly makes that person great and
14,"00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,840",to understand a person believed that it
15,"00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,800",takes respect and time like he spent 6
16,"00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,680",hours with Fidel smoking cigars before

18,"00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,239",out of him and for chst Pablo Cals ksh
19,"00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,200",saw that what made him great was his
20,"00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,000",dedication so his portrait doesn't even
21,"00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,440",show his face which is way different
22,"00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,079",than the way you would photograph an
23,"00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,840",artist whose passion makes them great
24,"00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,120",celebrity portraits these days can be
25,"00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,640",Lush and visually interesting but it's
26,"00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,920",really special when the photographer
27,"00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,719",knows how to capture that unique thing
