1,"00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,019",Human existence is scary and confusing.
2,"00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:09,600","A few hundred thousand years ago, we became conscious and found ourselves in a strange place."
3,"00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,820",It was filled with other beings. We could eat some; some could eat us.
4,"00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,500",There was liquid stuff we could drink; things we could use to make more things.
5,"00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,900",The daytime sky had a tiny yellow ball that warmed our skin.
6,"00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,620",The night sky was filled with beautiful lights.
7,"00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,100",This place was obviously made for us.
8,"00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,940",Something was watching over us.
9,"00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,020",We were home. This made everything much less scary and confusing.
10,"00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,960","But the older we got, the more we learned about the world and ourselves."
11,"00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,660","We learned that the twinkling lights are not shining beautifully for us, they just are."
12,"00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,840","We learned that we're not at the center of what we now call the universe,"
13,"00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,900","and that it is much, much older than we thought."
14,"00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,600","We learned that we're made of many little dead things,"
15,"00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,680","which make up bigger things that are not dead, for some reason,"
16,"00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,380",and that we're just another temporary stage in a history going back over a billion years.
17,"00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,320","We learned, in awe, that we live on a moist speck of dust moving around a medium-sized star"
18,"00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,840","in a quiet region of one arm of an average galaxy, which is part of a galaxy group that we will never leave."
19,"00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,720","And this group is only one of thousands that, together, make up a galaxy supercluster."
20,"00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,860",But even our supercluster is only one in thousands that make up what we call the observable universe.
21,"00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,580","The universe might be a million times bigger, but we will never know."
22,"00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,740",We can throw words around like two hundred million galaxies
23,"00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,560","or trillions of stars or bazillions of planets,"
24,"00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,240",but all of these numbers mean nothing. Our brains can't comprehend these concepts.
25,"00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,000",The universe is too big. There is too much of it.
26,"00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,520",But size is not the most troubling concept we have to deal with.
27,"00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,380","It's time, or, more precisely, the time we have."
28,"00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,960","If you're lucky enough to live to one hundred,"
29,"00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,120",you have five thousand two hundred weeks at your disposal.
30,"00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,960","If you're twenty-five now, then you have three thousand nine hundred weeks left."
31,"00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:05,800","If you're going to die at seventy, then there are two thousand three hundred and forty weeks left -"
32,"00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,760","a lot of time, but also ... not really."
33,"00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,700",And then what?
34,"00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,740","Your biological processes will break down,"
35,"00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,060",and the dynamic pattern that is you will stop beinge dynamic.
36,"00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,580",It will dissolve until there is no you left.
37,"00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,935","Some believe that there is a part of us we can't see or measure,"
38,"00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,220","but we have no way to find out, so this life might be it"
39,"00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,800",and we might end up dead forever.
40,"00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,180","This is less scary than it sounds, though."
41,"00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,720","If you don't remember the 13.75 billion years that went by before you existed,"
42,"00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,980",Then the trillions and trillions and trillions of years that come after will pass in no time once you're gone.
43,"00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,840",Close your eyes. Count to 1.
44,"00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,560",That's how long forever feels.
45,"00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:55,680","And as far as we know, in the end, the universe itself will die and nothing will ever change again."
46,"00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,320","Our videos induce existential dread in many people,"
47,"00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,560",and the last few minutes probably haven't helped.
48,"00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,380","So, for once, we want to offer a different way of looking at these things:"
49,"00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:10,760","an unscientific, subjective point of view, the philosophy of Kurzgesagt, if you want."
50,"00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,540",Please take it with a grain of salt; we don't know any more about human existence than you do.
51,"00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,780",We counter existential dread with optimistic nihilism.
52,"00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,360",What do we mean by that?
53,"00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:28,240","Well, to summarize, it seems very unlikely that 200 trillion trillion stars have been made for us."
54,"00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,980","In a way, it feels like the cruelest joke in existence has been played on us."
55,"00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,440",We became self-aware only to realize this story is not about us.
56,"00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,000","While it is great to know about electrons and the powerhouse of the cell,"
57,"00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,200",Science doesn't do a lot to make this less depressing.
58,"00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,660","Okay, but so what?"
59,"00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,920","You only get one shot at life, which is scary, but it also sets you free."
60,"00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,580","If the universe ends in heat death, every humiliation you suffer in your life will be forgotten."
61,"00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,700",Every mistake you made will not matter in the end.
62,"00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,600",Every bad thing you did will be voided.
63,"00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,460","If our life is all we get to experience, then it's the only thing that matters."
64,"00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:11,580","If the universe has no principles, the only principles relevant are the ones we decide on."
65,"00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,240","If the universe has no purpose, then we get to dictate what its purpose is."
66,"00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,040","Humans will most certainly cease to exist at some point,"
67,"00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,560","but before we do, we get to explore ourselves and the world around us."
68,"00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,960","We get to experience feelings. We get to experience food, books, sunrises, and being with each other."
69,"00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,920",The fact that we're even able to think about these things is already kind of incredible.
70,"00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,840","It's easy to think of ourselves as separated from everything, but this is not true."
71,"00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,780",We are as much the universe as a neutron star
72,"00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,980",or a black hole or a nebula.
73,"00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,455","Even better, actually, we are its thinking and feeling part:"
74,"00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,060",the centre organs of the universe.
75,"00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,435","We are truly free in a universe-sized playground,"
76,"00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,400",so we might as well aim to be happy and to build some kind of utopia in the stars.
77,"00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,400",It's not as if we've found out everything there is to know
78,"00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,140","We don't know why the rules of the universe are as they are,"
79,"00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,540","how life came into existence, what life is."
80,"00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,560",We have no idea what consciousness is or if we are alone in the universe.
81,"00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,060",But we can try to find some answers.
82,"00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,980","There are billions of stars to visit, diseases to cure,"
83,"00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,920","people to help, happy feelings to be experienced,"
84,"00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,900",and video games to finish.
85,"00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,160",There is so much to do.
86,"00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,940","So, wrapping up, you've probably used up a good chunk of the time available to you."
87,"00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:37,040","If this is our one shot at life, there is no reason not to have fun"
88,"00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,840",and live as happy as possible.
89,"00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,400",Bonus points if you made the life of other people better.
90,"00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,980",More bonus points if you help build a galactic human empire.
91,"00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,320",Do the things that make you feel good.
